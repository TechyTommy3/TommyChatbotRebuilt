# TommyChatbot
A remade version of TommyChatbot, made in Python! While, TommyChatbot wasn't very impresive.
# How it works
TommyChatbot doesn't understand what you say. Yes, seriously!
What TommyChatbot does is check for a certain reponses, or certain words, or certain something.
When it finds it, it runs the correct actions for it, which is thinking about it, and printing a message onto your screen.
No AI or internet involved.

The core version of Python contains everything you need.
